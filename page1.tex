\begin{abstract}
Computer vision has addressed many problems in art, but has not yet looked in
detail at the way artistic style can develop and evolve over the course of an
artist's career. In this paper we take a computational approach to modelling
stylistic change in the body of work amassed by Sir John “Kyffin” Williams, a
nationally renowned and prolific Welsh artist. Using images gathered from
catalogues and online sources, we use a leave-one-out methodology to classify
paintings by year; despite the variation in image source, size, and quality we
are able to obtain significant correlations between predicted year and actual
year, and we are able to guess the age of the painting within 15 years, for
around 70\% of our dataset. We also investigate the incorporation of expert
knowledge within this framework by considering a subset of paintings chosen as
exemplars by a scholar familiar with Williams' work.
